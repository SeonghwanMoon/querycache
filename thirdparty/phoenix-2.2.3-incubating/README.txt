Apache Phoenix [1] Incubator project is a SQL skin over HBase delivered as a client-embedded 
JDBC driver targeting low latency queries over HBase data. Apache Phoenix takes your SQL query, 
compiles it into a series of HBase scans, and orchestrates the running of those scans to produce 
regular JDBC result sets.

To get started using Phoenix, see the About and Using section on Phoenix website [1]
